### Introduction and Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s mental health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness. Most studies reported psychological effects such as stress, anxiety, fear and loneliness. The mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression can worsen in workplaces. The pandemic has changed the working norm and provided the flexibility to work from home. We are trying to analyse the imapct of work flexibility on mental health amongst employees in tech companies.
For this hackathon challenge,we decided to use this dataset to understand how mental health in the workplace is impacted, analyze different demographics including gender, age, geography, examine the frequency of mental health consequences among tech workers and see what are the factors that are affecting employees’ mental health and how can companies change few policies to improve the situation. The Opening Sourcing and Mental illness’s primary goal is to change how mental health is spoken about in the tech community by spreading awareness, educating about mental disorders, and providing safe and supportive resources for those with mental health issues.
The data set consists of 63 variables with a total of 1433 observations. In process of cleaning the data, we observed a few inconsistencies, for example the highest age as 323. Such issues were addressed by cleaning and filtering out data relevant to the study. The data set contains a total of 1433 responses out of which 1059 belong to ‘Male’, 340 belong to ‘Female’ and 34 to the ‘Other’ category. The survey includes responses from multiple states in United States of America and multiple countries worldwide. The survey was conducted online and responses obtained was voluntary responses. Hence, the survey, and the inferences that have been obtained from this data set cannot be generalized for the entire technical industry.

### The following themes have been covered in this hackathon –
1. Understanding the demographics about the survey of mental health conducted
2. Analyzing the responses provided which are mental health and mental health consequences.
3. Analyzing benefits and wellness programs offered by companies, and behavior of employees with mental health
